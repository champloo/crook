{"id":"crook-2l4.4","title":"Refactor LsModel for multi-pane rendering","description":"Major refactor of the LsModel to display all three panes simultaneously instead of tab-based single-view navigation.\n\n## Context\n\nThis is the core implementation task. The current `LsModel` uses `TabBar` to switch between single views. The refactor replaces this with a multi-pane layout where all three resource types (Nodes, Deployments/Pods, OSDs) are visible simultaneously in stacked rows.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n**File to modify:** `pkg/tui/models/ls.go`\n\n### 1. Replace Tab System with Pane System\n\n**Replace enum:**\n```go\n// OLD\ntype LsTab int\nconst (\n    LsTabNodes LsTab = iota\n    LsTabDeployments\n    LsTabOSDs\n    LsTabPods\n)\n\n// NEW\ntype LsPane int\nconst (\n    LsPaneNodes LsPane = iota\n    LsPaneDeployments  // Also handles pods toggle\n    LsPaneOSDs\n)\n```\n\n**Update LsModel struct:**\n```go\ntype LsModel struct {\n    // ... existing fields ...\n    \n    // REMOVE: tabBar *components.TabBar\n    \n    // ADD:\n    activePane          LsPane\n    panes               [3]*components.Pane\n    deploymentsPodsView *views.DeploymentsPodsView  // Replaces separate views\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Update NewLsModel Constructor\n\n- Create 3 Pane components instead of TabBar\n- Create DeploymentsPodsView wrapper\n- Initialize activePane to LsPaneNodes\n- Set up pane configs with titles and shortcut keys\n\n### 3. Update handleKeyPress()\n\n**New key bindings:**\n```go\ncase \"tab\":\n    m.nextPane()  // Cycle: Nodes -\u003e Deps -\u003e OSDs -\u003e Nodes\ncase \"shift+tab\":\n    m.prevPane()  // Cycle backwards\ncase \"1\":\n    m.setActivePane(LsPaneNodes)\ncase \"2\":\n    m.setActivePane(LsPaneDeployments)\ncase \"3\":\n    m.setActivePane(LsPaneOSDs)\ncase \"[\":\n    if m.activePane == LsPaneDeployments {\n        m.deploymentsPodsView.ShowDeployments()\n    }\ncase \"]:\n    if m.activePane == LsPaneDeployments {\n        m.deploymentsPodsView.ShowPods()\n    }\n```\n\n**Cursor navigation only affects active pane:**\n- j/k, up/down should only move cursor in the active pane\n- Other panes retain their cursor positions\n\n### 4. Update View() for Multi-Pane Rendering\n\n```go\nfunc (m *LsModel) View() string {\n    var b strings.Builder\n    \n    // Header (unchanged)\n    b.WriteString(m.header.View())\n    b.WriteString(\"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    // Pane navigation bar (replaces tab bar)\n    b.WriteString(m.renderPaneNavBar())\n    b.WriteString(\"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    // Calculate height distribution\n    availableHeight := m.height - headerHeight - navBarHeight - statusBarHeight\n    activeHeight := availableHeight / 2      // 50%\n    inactiveHeight := availableHeight / 4    // 25% each\n    \n    // Render all three panes\n    for i, pane := range m.panes {\n        isActive := LsPane(i) == m.activePane\n        height := inactiveHeight\n        if isActive {\n            height = activeHeight\n        }\n        \n        // Set size on view and get content\n        content := m.getViewContent(LsPane(i), height)\n        \n        // Wrap in pane with appropriate styling\n        pane.SetActive(isActive)\n        pane.SetSize(m.width, height)\n        b.WriteString(pane.View(content))\n        b.WriteString(\"\\n\")\n    }\n    \n    // Status bar with context-sensitive hints\n    b.WriteString(m.renderStatusBar())\n    \n    return b.String()\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Update Status Bar\n\nShow toggle hint only when deployments pane is active:\n```go\nfunc (m *LsModel) renderStatusBar() string {\n    hints := []string{\"Tab/1-3: pane\", \"j/k: navigate\"}\n    if m.activePane == LsPaneDeployments {\n        hints = append(hints, \"[/]: deps/pods\")\n    }\n    hints = append(hints, \"/: filter\", \"?: help\", \"q: quit\")\n    return styles.StyleSubtle.Render(strings.Join(hints, \"  \"))\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Update Help Overlay\n\nUpdate keyboard shortcuts in help overlay to reflect new navigation.\n\n### 7. Helper Methods to Add\n\n- `nextPane()` - Cycle to next pane\n- `prevPane()` - Cycle to previous pane  \n- `setActivePane(pane LsPane)` - Direct pane selection\n- `renderPaneNavBar() string` - Render navigation bar with badges\n- `getViewContent(pane LsPane, height int) string` - Get view content at specified height\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Requires: crook-2l4.1 (pane styles)\n- Requires: crook-2l4.2 (Pane component)\n- Requires: crook-2l4.3 (DeploymentsPodsView)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All three panes visible simultaneously\n- [ ] Active pane gets 50% height, inactive panes get 25% each\n- [ ] Tab/Shift+Tab cycles through panes\n- [ ] 1/2/3 keys directly select panes\n- [ ] `[` and `]` toggle deployments/pods in middle pane\n- [ ] Cursor navigation only affects active pane\n- [ ] Status bar shows context-sensitive hints\n- [ ] Help overlay updated with new keybindings\n- [ ] Filter still applies to all views\n- [ ] Existing table content unchanged (columns, rendering)\n- [ ] All tests pass\n- [ ] Code passes linting","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","estimated_minutes":240,"created_at":"2026-01-06T16:41:34.088453595+11:00","created_by":"andri","updated_at":"2026-01-06T16:56:49.629375966+11:00","closed_at":"2026-01-06T16:56:49.629375966+11:00","close_reason":"Refactored LsModel to use multi-pane layout with LsPane enum, 3 panes array, and DeploymentsPodsView wrapper","labels":["model","refactor","tui"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"crook-2l4.4","depends_on_id":"crook-2l4","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-06T16:41:34.101676819+11:00","created_by":"andri"},{"issue_id":"crook-2l4.4","depends_on_id":"crook-2l4.1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-06T16:41:34.107282347+11:00","created_by":"andri"},{"issue_id":"crook-2l4.4","depends_on_id":"crook-2l4.2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-06T16:41:34.110120813+11:00","created_by":"andri"},{"issue_id":"crook-2l4.4","depends_on_id":"crook-2l4.3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-06T16:41:34.114176129+11:00","created_by":"andri"}]}
